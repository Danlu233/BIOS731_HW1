1. Source Folder
   Contains R functions used in the analysis:
    01_simulate_data.R: Simulates the dataset.
    02_apply_method.R: Applies linear regression to the simulated data.
    03_extract_estimates.R: Extracts estimates and calculates Wald confidence intervals.
    04_nonparametric_boot_percentile_ci.R: Computes bootstrap percentile confidence intervals.
    05_nonparametric_boot_t_ci.R: Computes bootstrap t-quantile confidence intervals.

2. Simulation Folder
   Contains the script that runs the simulation using the functions from the Source Folder:
   run_simulation.R: This script calls the functions in the Source Folder to perform the simulation.

3. Data Folder
   Stores the simulation results by scenario. The results generated by run_simulation.R are saved here.

4. Analysis Folder
   Contains code for exploring the simulation results and generating the final report:
   exploratory_analysis.R: Scripts for exploratory analysis of the simulation results, generating tables and figures.
   final_report.Rmd: Code for generating final report.

5. Results Folder
   Stores the tables and figures generated from the exploratory analysis. These files are used in the final report.
