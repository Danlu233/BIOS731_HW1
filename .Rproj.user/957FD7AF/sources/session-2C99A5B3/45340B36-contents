### Problem 1.1 ADEMP Structure 


* I will run 18 simulation scenarios.
* Estimand is $\beta_{treatment}$
* Wald confidence intervals, nonparametric boostrap percentile intervals and nonparametric bootstrap t intervals are being compared.
* Performance measures include bias, empirical standard error, and coverage.


### Problem 1.2 nSim 

Based on desired coverage of 95\% with Monte Carlo error of no more than 1\%, 475 simulations should be performed for each simulation scenario.


### Problem 1.3 Implementation 

### Problem 1.4 Results summary

Create a plot or table to summarize simulation results across scenarios and methods for each of the following. 

- Bias of $\hat{\beta}$
- Coverage of $\hat{\beta}$
- Distribution of $se(\hat{\beta})$
- Computation time across methods

If creating a plot, I encourage faceting. Include informative captions for each plot and/or table.

### Problem 1.5 Discussion

Interpret the results summarized in Problem 1.4. First, write a **paragraph** summarizing the main findings of your simulation study. Then, answer the specific questions below.

- How do the different methods for constructing confidence intervals compare in terms of computation time?
- Which method(s) for constructing confidence intervals provide the best coverage when $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, 2)$?
- Which method(s) for constructing confidence intervals provide the best coverage when $\epsilon_i \sim logNormal(0, \log (2))$?
